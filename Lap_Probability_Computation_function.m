#This function computes the conditional probability of the last word in a n-gram with respect to the rest of the words in that n-gram througth the Laplace's (Lap) method. This receives the n-gram in String, two structs called Statistics1 and Statistics2 that contain all the statistics learned from a training corpus for the n-grams and for the (n-1)-grams respectivelly, as the inputs and returns the conditional probability of the last word of n-gram as the output.
 

#Inputs:
#	String:			The n-gram string whose probability want to be computed.
#	Statistics1		A structure with statistical data for n-grams from the corpus.
#	Statistics1.Histogram:	The histogram from the corpus.
#	Statistics1.N:		The size of the corpus.
#	Statistics1.V:		The vocabulary size.
#	Statistics1.Histogram:	The histogram from the corpus.
#	Statistics1.Nr:		An array with the frequencies of frequencies of the n-grams in the corpus.
#	Statistics2		A structure with statistical data for (n-1)-grams from the corpus.
#	Statistics2.Histogram:	The histogram from the corpus.
#	Statistics2.N:		The size of the corpus.
#	Statistics2.V:		The vocabulary size.
#	Statistics2.Histogram:	The histogram from the corpus.
#	Statistics2.Nr:		An array with the frequencies of frequencies of the n-grams in the corpus.

#Outputs:
#	Cond_Probability:	The conditional probability of the last word in the n-gram.
